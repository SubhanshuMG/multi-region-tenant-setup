1. Overview

This setup automates the deployment of a secure, multi-tenant infrastructure across multiple regions with AWS. It includes:
	•	Frontend: A React application deployed to S3 or a CDN.
	•	Backend: A Node.js application running on AWS ECS.
	•	Database: A PostgreSQL instance using AWS RDS.
	•	Networking: A VPC with private subnets for secure communication.
	•	Deployment Pipeline: Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

2. Components

	1.	Terraform:
	•	Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Defines cloud resources (VPC, ECS, RDS) to be deployed in specific regions.
	•	Modules:
	•	VPC: Creates a secure network environment.
	•	ECS: Manages containers for the backend.
	•	RDS: Deploys PostgreSQL in private subnets.
	2.	React Frontend:
	•	Built using npm run build.
	•	Deployed to S3 for static hosting.
	3.	Node.js Backend:
	•	Dockerized backend app.
	•	Runs on AWS ECS using Fargate.
	4.	CI/CD Pipeline:
	•	GitHub Actions automate the deployment of the frontend and backend to AWS.

3. Steps to Set Up and Run

3.1. Prerequisites

	•	AWS CLI: Install and configure with your credentials (aws configure).
	•	Terraform CLI: Install Terraform (>=1.3.0).
	•	Node.js: Install Node.js (>=16.x) and npm.
	•	Docker: Install Docker for container management.

3.2. Infrastructure Deployment

	1.	Initialize Terraform:
Navigate to the terraform/ directory and run:

terraform init


	2.	Set Up Variables:
Update variables.tf with:
	•	Region
	•	VPC CIDR block
	•	Database credentials.
	3.	Deploy Infrastructure:
Execute the Terraform commands:

terraform apply

This deploys:
	•	VPC with private subnets.
	•	ECS cluster and services for the backend.
	•	RDS PostgreSQL instance.

	4.	Output Resources:
After the deployment, Terraform provides outputs such as VPC ID, Subnet IDs, and ECS cluster.

3.3. React Frontend

	1.	Build Frontend:
In the frontend/ directory, run:

npm install
npm run build


	2.	Deploy to S3:
Sync the build/ folder to your S3 bucket:

aws s3 sync ./build s3://your-s3-bucket-name

Update your CloudFront distribution if applicable.

3.4. Node.js Backend

	1.	Build Docker Image:
Navigate to the backend/ directory and run:

docker build -t backend-app .


	2.	Push to Container Registry:
Push the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR):

aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker tag backend-app:latest <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/backend-app:latest
docker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/backend-app:latest


	3.	Update ECS Task Definition:
Update the ECS task definition to point to the new Docker image and force a new deployment.

3.5. CI/CD Pipeline

	1.	Configure GitHub Actions:
	•	Add AWS credentials as secrets in the GitHub repository.
	•	Use .github/workflows/deploy.yml to automate:
	•	React frontend build and deployment to S3.
	•	Backend ECS deployment.
	2.	Trigger Pipeline:
Push changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline.

4. Region-Specific Setup

	•	Use Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments for each region:

terraform workspace new eu-region
terraform apply


	•	Update the region variable to ensure resources stay within a specific geographical boundary (GDPR, CCPA compliance).

5. Privacy and Security

	•	Data Residency:
	•	Ensure database, S3 buckets, and ECS services are region-specific.
	•	Enforce IAM policies to prevent cross-region access.
	•	Encryption:
	•	Use AWS KMS for encrypting S3, RDS, and other sensitive data.
	•	Monitoring:
	•	Enable CloudWatch for resource monitoring.
	•	Set up alerts for resource thresholds.
